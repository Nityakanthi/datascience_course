## Course Summary: Foundations of Data Science

### Key Concepts and Techniques
- Visualization of Data
 - Numerical Data: Histogram, box plot, scatter plot, line chart.
 - Categorical Data: Bar plot, pie chart, frequency table.

- Correlation and Linear Regression
 - Understanding relationships between variables.
 - Building predictive models using linear regression.

- Clustering Techniques
 - K-Means Clustering: Centroid-based clustering and evaluation using Rand index and silhouette score.
 - Hierarchical Clustering: Connectivity-based clustering with dendrograms.
 - DBSCAN: Density-based clustering for non-linear clusters.

- Classification
 - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Instance-based learning classifier.

- Evaluation Metrics
 - Cross-validation for model reliability.
 - Precision, recall for classification performance.

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 - Margin-based classification for linear and non-linear data.

- Ensemble Methods
 - Random Forest: Bagging-based ensemble for robust predictions.
 - AdaBoost: Boosting-based ensemble for improving weak learners.

- Feature Selection
 - Techniques: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Chi-squared test.

- Dimensionality Reduction
 - Simplifying data complexity for better visualization and modeling.

- Parameter Optimization
 - Fine-tuning models for optimal performance using grid search and random search.
